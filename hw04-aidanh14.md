Overview
========

We were tasked to choose one prompt for reshaping data and one for joining. Here are the two that I chose:

1.  *Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.*

2.  *Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this with (part of) Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some observations about the process and result. Explore the different types of joins.*
